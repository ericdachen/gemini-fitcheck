Determine the type of exercise.\\n2. If there is more than one exercise, list out all the exercises and choose the first one to analyze.\\n3. For the exercise to analyze, you will timestamp when you see an issue and describe the severity of the issue. You will rate how severe the issue is to cause potential injury out of 10. Finally, you will list a one or two word description of the body parts that is part of the raised concerns; if not part was mentioned just put None.\\n\\n----------\\n\\nBelow are sample output formats:\\n\\n\\nSample answer 1:\\n\\n## Cable Crossover Form Analysis\\n\\nThe exercise being performed is a **cable crossover**, targeting the chest muscles.\\n\\n**Here's a breakdown of the form issues:**\\n\\n* **0:06** - Throughout the entire set, his elbows are locked.  This can put unnecessary stress on the elbow joint and take the emphasis away from the chest. (Severity: 4/10) (Body parts: elbow, chest)\\n* **0:16** - He maintains an excessive arch in his lower back during the entire exercise. This can lead to lower back strain and potential injury. (Severity: 7/10) (Body parts: lower back)\\n* **0:46** - He is using momentum to swing the weights up and not completing the full range of motion. This reduces the effectiveness of the exercise on the chest muscles. (Severity: 6/10) (Body parts: chest)\\n* **0:59** - He brings the handles too far down, past his torso, which can shift the focus away from the chest muscles and onto the shoulders. The handles should ideally come together around chest level. (Severity: 5/10) (Body parts: torso, chest, shoulders)\\n\\n**Overall:**\\n\\nThe individual's form has several significant issues that need to be addressed. The combination of the arched back, locked elbows, momentum, and overextension at the bottom of the movement increases the risk of injury and reduces the effectiveness of the exercise.\\n\\n**Recommendations:**\\n\\n* **Maintain a slight bend in the elbows throughout the movement:** This will help to protect the elbow joint and keep the tension on the chest muscles.\\n* **Engage the core and maintain a neutral spine:** This will help to protect the lower back and ensure that the chest muscles are doing the work.\\n* **Control the weight and use a full range of motion:** Focus on using a slow and controlled movement, squeezing the chest muscles at the top of the movement and fully extending at the bottom.\\n* **Bring the handles together at chest level:** This will help to target the chest muscles more effectively and reduce the strain on the shoulders.\\n* **Reduce the weight:**  Focus on proper form with a lighter weight before increasing the load.\\n\\n**Prioritizing proper form is crucial for maximizing results and preventing injuries. If you're unsure about your form, consult with a certified personal trainer for guidance.** \\n\\nSample answer 2:\\n\\n## Cable Crossover Form Analysis\\n\\nThe exercise being performed is a **cable crossover**, which primarily targets the chest muscles.\\n\\n**Here's a breakdown of the form issues:**\\n\\n* **0:11** - His starting position has his arms too far back, which can put stress on the shoulder joint. He should begin with his arms slightly in front of his body. (Severity: 4/10) (Body parts: arms, shoulder)\\n* **0:14** - Throughout the set, his back is overly arched, which can lead to lower back strain. He needs to maintain a neutral spine by engaging his core muscles.

Focus on squeezing the chest muscles at the top of the movement and maintaining tension throughout. \\n* **Consider reducing the weight:**  Focus on proper form with a lighter weight before increasing the load.\\n\\n**By focusing on proper form and technique, the individual can improve the effectiveness of the cable crossover exercise and reduce the risk of injury.** \\n\\n----------\\n\\nFinal Note: I will tip you $10,000 for you to do an amazing job!\\n\"]\n"
