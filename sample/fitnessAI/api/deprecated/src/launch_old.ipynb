       "> * **Control the lowering phase:** Lower the legs slowly and with control, resisting the urge to drop them quickly. This maximizes muscle engagement and time under tension.\n",
       "> * **Engage the core throughout the movement:** Focus on keeping the core tight and avoid arching the back. This ensures that the core muscles are doing the work and reduces the risk of injury.\n",
       "> * **Consider using an assisted machine or resistance bands if needed:** These can provide support and make it easier to perform the exercise with proper form.\n",
