    "* **0:46** - He is using momentum to swing the weights up and not completing the full range of motion. This reduces the effectiveness of the exercise on the chest muscles. (Severity: 6/10) (Body parts: chest)\n",
    "* **0:59** - He brings the handles too far down, past his torso, which can shift the focus away from the chest muscles and onto the shoulders. The handles should ideally come together around chest level. (Severity: 5/10) (Body parts: torso, chest, shoulders)\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Maintain a slight bend in the elbows throughout the movement:** This will help to protect the elbow joint and keep the tension on the chest muscles.\n",
    "* **Engage the core and maintain a neutral spine:** This will help to protect the lower back and ensure that the chest muscles are doing the work.\n",
    "* **Control the weight and use a full range of motion:** Focus on using a slow and controlled movement, squeezing the chest muscles at the top of the movement and fully extending at the bottom.\n",
